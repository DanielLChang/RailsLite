# RailsLite
A light version of Ruby on Rails web framework. The purpose of this Rails Lite project is to demonstrate understanding of MVC, the Ruby on Rails framework, and ActiveRecord-assisted SQL commands.

##Future Implementations
+ Combine Rails Lite & ActiveRecord Lite
+ Handle "PATCH" and "DELETE" requests
+ Implement link_to and button_to
+ Strong params (e.g require, permit)
+ URL route helpers (e.g. users_url instead of "/users')
